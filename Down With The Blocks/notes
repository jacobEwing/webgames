=================== initial brainstorm ===========================
A total rebbot/improvement of "ballz-online" (presumably just ballz")
it's like breakout, but instead fo having a ball that you bounce on a pad, you
launch the balls from a single point, hitting the bricks.  The impacts decrease
the brick's number, and it disappears at zero.  Numbers tend to be the same as
your number of balls, but sometimes double that.

It could be SOOO much better revamped.  The graphics are crapped, so that would
be an easy improvement.

Also, power-ups.  Some ideas there:
 - fireball that burns through blocks - one ball and one time only
 - bonus ball - give you an additional ball for more power
 - lasers shoot up/down/left/right, blasting through every block in their path
 - aiming assistance, a line tracing the projected path of the ball
 - make the floor bouncy for ten seconds
 - gun - maybe for ten seconds, or maybe only usable when you are not launching balls and balls are in the air.
 - temporary damage multiplier (next launch, or maybe
 - balls are destroyed on impact with bricks, giving 10X or some other factor
   of the normal damage
 - Balls are launched by holding mouse, with direction changing with mouse motion

More MAYBE ideas:
- game area increase - a one time boost that increases the area of the game.
   Increasing height would give more time to destroy blocks, Increasing width
   would give more blocks per row, increasing difficulty.
 - Splitting the launchpoint, perhaps leaving the balls per launchpoint untouched
 - brief gravity control
 - balls that can bounce off the floor a certain number of times, with a number
   showing how many times they have left
 - all balls split on next impact
 - set launch point
 - double game speed
 - halve game speed


 Some other touch-ups:
 - add occasional spinning blocks that the ball bounces off at varying angles
 - special bonus when all blocks are cleared
 - Animated scrolling background of various textures
 - Perhaps not square bricks.. Maybe not even numbers, although I think they're
   important.
