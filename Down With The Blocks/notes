=================== initial brainstorm ===========================
A total rebbot/improvement of "ballz-online" (presumably just ballz")
it's like breakout, but instead fo having a ball that you bounce on a pad, you
launch the balls from a single point, hitting the bricks.  The impacts decrease
the brick's number, and it disappears at zero.  Numbers tend to be the same as
your number of balls, but sometimes double that.

It could be SOOO much better revamped.  The graphics are crapped, so that would
be an easy improvement.

Also, power-ups.  Some ideas there:
 - game area increase - a one time boost that increases the area of the game.
   Increasing height would give more time to destroy blocks, Increasing width
   would give more blocks per row, increasing difficulty.

 - Splitting the launchpoint, perhaps leaving the balls per launchpoint untouched

 - aiming assistance, a line tracing the projected path of the ball
 - make the floor bouncy for ten seconds
 - all balls split on next impact
 - gun
 - fireballs for more damage
 - set launch point
 - double game speed
 - halve game speed
 - brief gravity control
 - damage multiplier
 - balls are destroyed on impact with bricks, giving 10X or some other factor
   of the normal damage
 - Balls are launched by holding mouse, with direction changing with mouse motion


 Some other touch-ups:
 - add occasional spinning blocks that the ball bounces off at varying angles
 - special bonus when all blocks are cleared
 - Animated scrolling background of various textures
 - Perhaps not square bricks.. Maybe not even numbers, although I think they're
   important.
 - perhaps instead of the balls being launched from the first fall spot, the
   mouse would move the pad left and right until the button is pressed, at
   which point motion changes the angle.
 - The balls can be of varying colours.  Perhaps the blocks that provide them
   can be of varying colours, which determine the colour of the balls.
